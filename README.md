# About the codes
The codes refer to the calculations in the manuscript:
"Oceanic non-Kolmogorov optical turbulence and spherical wave propagation"
https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02447
The manuscript is now being peer reviewed.

## We will be very glad if these codes can help readers understand and reproduce the work of above paper.

Besides, a follow-up study after above paper will be obtaining the analytical expression of the coherence radius which requires proper mathematical approximations and simplying.
To our knowledge, above requirements should be done in considering the optical inner scale and the detail expression of T-S coupled spectrum. Thus, traditional approximation methods may need to be improved.

We hope to discuss this issue with the readers and even cooperate in the follow-up study.
